# PAT: Pepper-Pot Analysis Tool
## Project Details

In order to minimize beam losses, it is very important to have a good understanding of the beam condition, such as the emittance of the particle beam. A Pepper-Pot Emittance Meter (PEM) can be used to study the beam phase space. It is a particle beam imaging system whose measurement result can be used to reconstruct the 4D beam transverse phase space of the charged particle beam. In this project, Pepper-Pot Analysis Tool (PAT) was developed to reconstruct the 4D beam transverse phase space based on the PEM measurement.
